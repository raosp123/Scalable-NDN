	its a manual setup, where you use a terminal on a device, to manually connect a new device as its peer
	
	1. the public key of the new peer

	2. the port of the new peer

	3. assign a name to the new peer that fits within the network (done automatically)

					
We assume any new device joining the network, is empty and has no existing data or sensors connected to it already.

initiate_join --new_peer_public_key=wdawdwadawd --new_peer_port=9002

[							]

once an existing device facilitates a new node joining, the existing device tells all of its peers that they can reach the new device through themselves


	1. existing device encrypts test packet with new device public key, sends it to the new device over the port. Waits for new device
	   to decrypt packet and send

		[type: network_authenticate, pbk-authenticator:dev1_pbkey, encypt_message: a2W$j] -> new joining device


		new device decrypts message, then encrypts with dev1_pbkey(), and sends back to the dev1.

			Dev1 handles one of two cases:
					1. new device successfully decrypted message:
							send message ("Sucess")
							name_joining_node(
								search my routing table, get the highest value device_{num}, add 1 to it
								and name the new node device{max_num+1}
							)
							named_successfully = send packet to new device saying[type: "naming_request", your_new_name: "device_X"]
							if (named_successfully)
								routing_gossip() #tells the rest of network how to reach the new device
							
					2. it fails
						send message ("you failed to join the network")
						
			New device()
					1. if we have succesfully joined:
						
						wait for our name, then name ourselves.
						
						send confirmation back to exisiting device
						
						
						
Edge Cases:

     1. device disconnects, but gets new data
	if device can't communicate with network, but it got new interests from a new sensor, it waits to send gossip data packet, keeps trying
	until it succeeds (Should be done)
